          <h2>Harry Potter And The Cursed Child</h2>
          <h1>By JK Rowling</h1>
          <p>The official playscript of the original West End production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.<span
              id="dots">...</span>

            <span id="more">It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is an
              overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children.

              While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must
              struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both
              father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.

              The playscript for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was originally released as a 'special rehearsal
              edition' alongside the opening of Jack Thorne's play in London's West End in summer 2016. Based on an
              original story by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany and Jack Thorne, the play opened to rapturous reviews from
              theatregoers and critics alike, while the official playscript became an immediate global bestseller.

              This definitive and final playscript updates the 'special rehearsal edition' with the conclusive and final
              dialogue from the play, which has subtly changed since its rehearsals, as well as a conversation piece
              between director John Tiffany and writer Jack Thorne, who share stories and insights about reading
              playscripts. This edition also includes useful background information including the Potter
              family tree and a timeline of events from the Wizarding World prior to the beginning of Harry Potter and
              the Cursed Child.</span></p>
